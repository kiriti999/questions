<!-- #region What is component resolver in angular ? -->
What is component resolver in angular ?
// component resolver will enable a generated factory to be attached to component so that
we can call "create instance" to create component.
<!-- #endregion -->


<!-- #region What are chunks in routing?  -->
What are chunks in routing?
// We have two types of chunks:
1. component-code-splitting
2. route-code-splitting

1. In component-level code splitting, you move components to their own JavaScript chunks and load them lazily when
they are needed with the use of "ngx-loadable-component"

2. To use route-level code splitting in Angular, set the loadChildren property of the route declaration and
combine it with a dynamic import:

{
                path: 'nyan',
loadChildren: () => import('./nyan/nyan.module').then(m => m.NyanModule)
}
<!-- #endregion -->



<!-- #region How do you create an exportable module in angular that can used by third party company? -->
Create a component and use it inside @Ngmodule and register it with @angular/elements API.

Example:
=======
@NgModule({
                imports: [BrowserModule],
declarations: [HelloComponent],
entryComponents: [HelloComponent]
})
export class HelloModule {
                ngDoBootstrap() {}
}

Register as custom element:
==========================
registerAsCustomElements([HelloComponent], () =>
platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(HelloModule)
);

NgElement class used to register all the components as custom elements extends HTMLElement class like a
vanilla js custom element should do.

And then build it using: `Webpack & Angular Compiler Plugin from @ngtools/webpack.`
and then use it in html page using: script src="dist/main.bundle.js"
<!-- #endregion -->



What is AOT compiling and What does it compile?
// complies templates in js files ahead of prod build with factory files.

What is reactive programming? //Rxjs (Observable - data flow asynchronously using events so not many threads are created)

How do you update multiple widgets from single source of data after making single api url call?

What is zone js?
//Zone js is execution context in js which has method zone.run() to track async events.

<!-- #region What is ngZone in angular? -->
// zonejs checks for change detection in angular using zone.run(){this.tick()} method
// Zone.run() method can capture changes for asynchronous events in angular like input, onchange, submit and then
angular will run through list of changeDetectionRef.

<!-- #region What is changeDetectionRef ref? -->
What is changeDetectionRef ref?
When ever we use changeDetectionStrategy to on push, we need to use markForChange() method to detect the changes.
<!-- #endregion -->


<!-- #region What is viewEncapsulation?  -->
What is viewEncapsulation?
Component styles overtake precedence by default.

ViewEncapsulation.Emulated is set by default in angular.
This allows that styles from main HTML propagate to the component
but styles defined in this component's @Component decorator are scoped to this component only.

ViewEncapsulation.None: styles from the component propagate back to the main HTML

ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom: styles from main HTML do not propagate to the component.

<!-- #region what is angular tree shaking? -->
Tree shaking is a step in a build process that removes unused code from a code base. Removing unused code can be thought
as “tree shaking,” or you can visualize the physical shaking of a tree and the remaining dead leaves falling off of the
tree. By using tree shaking, we can make sure our application only includes the code that is needed for our application
to run.

Example:

import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root'
})
export class SharedService {
    constructor() {}
}

In the @Injectable decorator we have a new property called providedIn. With this property we can tell Angular which
module to register our service to instead of having to import the module and register it to the providers of a NgModule.
By default, this syntax registers it to the root injector which will make our service an application wide singleton.

Where as `@Injectable()` will bundle the service even though not used.

what is light house in angular? 
// light house tool is provided by google to run audit like performance test in browser

<!-- #region How to run code outside zonejs? and then detect changes. -->
this.ngZone.runOutsideAngular(() => {
this.interval = window.setInterval(() => {
// execute code outside angular
// example: drag and drop, scroll events, setTimeout etc
}, 10)
});

to detect changes again, we need run it inside zone.run()

<!-- #region Difference between Renderer and ElementRef? -->
The Renderer is a class that is a partial abstraction over the DOM.
ElementRef has a direct reference to DOM like ElementRef.nativeElement which can lead to security issues - XSS attacks
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region @Input() and @Output() properties/decorators in angular/ parent and child communication? -->
https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular9-input-output

An @Input() property is writable while an @Output() property is observable.
    Consider this:
    <parent-component>
        <child-component></child-component>
    </parent-component>

    Input Example:
        From parent: <child-component[receivedParentMessage]="messageToSendP"></child-component>
        export class ItemDetailComponent {
            @Input() receivedParentMessage: string; // decorate the property with @Input()
        }
    
    Output Example:
        <button (click)="sendMessageToParent(messageToSendC)">Send to Parent</button>
        Inside childComponent.ts:
            @Output() decorator binds a property of a component to send data from child to calling component (parent).
            messageToEmit = new EventEmitter<string>();
            sendMessageToParent(message: string) {
                this.messageToEmit.emit(message)
            }
    Inside parentComponent.ts:
    <app-child (messageToEmit)="getMessage($event)"></app-child>
            receivedChildMessage: string;
            getMessage(message: string) {
                this.receivedChildMessage = message;
            }

<!-- #region Types of directives in angular? -->
Types of directives in angular?
1. Component directives - Components are directive in angular 
    eg: <app-name></app-name>

2. Structural directives - Removes or add dom based on condition.
Examples of Structural directive:
    1. *NgFor and *NgIf

3. attribute directive - change the appearance or behavior of an element, component or other directive.
Examples of attribute directives:
    1. NgClass—adds and removes a set of CSS classes.
    1a.TOGGLE: <!-- toggle the "special" class on/off with a property -->
    <div [ngClass]="isSpecial ? 'special' : ''">This div is special</div>
    2. NgStyle—adds and removes a set of HTML styles.
    3. NgModel—adds two-way data binding to an HTML form element.
    4. NgSwitch
    5. NgStyle
    6. Custom attribute directive: https://stackblitz.com/angular/dmvokxvannn?file=src%2Fapp%2Fhighlight.directive.ts
<!-- #endregion -->


<!-- #region Template reference variables (#var) -->
<input #phone placeholder="phone number" />
You can refer to a template reference variable anywhere in the component's template. 
Here, a <button> further down the template refers to the phone variable.
    <input #phone placeholder="phone number" />
    <!-- phone refers to the input element; pass its `value` to an event handler -->
    <button (click)="callPhone(phone.value)">Call</button>
<!-- #endregion -->


<!-- #region Types of binding in angular? -->
1. String interpolation {{}} 
Example: 
    1. 2*2 inside interpolation is called template expression
    2. {{item?.name}} interpolation with null check
    3. The $any() type cast function: {{$any(item).bestByDate}}
    3a. Sometimes a binding expression triggers a type error during AOT compilation and it is not possible or difficult to fully
    specify the type. To silence the error, you can use the $any() cast function to cast the expression to the any type

2. property binding <div><img [src]="image"></div> where `image` is component property/variable
    eg: <div [hidden]="!itemForm.form.valid">
            <p>{{ submitMessage }}</p>
        </div>
3. Event binding <button (click)="goBack()">Go back</button> lets you listen for certain events
    Example: Two way binding: <input [(ngModel)]="course.name" placeholder="name" />

<!-- #region Things to consider when designing angular app? -->
Angular architecture:

1. Create app structure considering the features
Example: 1. Customer features can have its own components, services etc
2. Reusable features/services can go into SharedService
Example: Pipes
3. Consider lazy loading modules
4. May be global error handling using errorHandler from core or http interceptor error handler. 
Check angular-error-handling file here: <file src="./angular-error-handling.html"></file>

Angular custom elements: 
========================
    Angular elements are Angular components packaged as custom elements (also called Web Components), 
    a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a framework-agnostic way.

    Custom elements are a Web Platform feature currently supported by Chrome, Edge (Chromium-based), Firefox, Opera, and Safari,
    and available in other browsers through polyfills

    A custom element extends HTML by allowing you to define a tag whose content is created and controlled by JavaScript code. 

    The @angular/elements package exports a createCustomElement() API that provides a bridge from Angular's component interface and 
    change detection functionality to the built-in DOM API.

    https://angular.io/guide/elements#how-it-works
    https://angular.io/guide/elements#typings-for-custom-elements

    Example:
    // This uses the new custom-element method to add the popup to the DOM.
    showAsElement(message: string) {
        // Create element
        const popupEl: NgElement & WithProperties<PopupComponent> = document.createElement('popup-element') as any;

        // Listen to the close event
        popupEl.addEventListener('closed', () => document.body.removeChild(popupEl));

        // Set the message
        popupEl.message = message;

        // Add to the DOM
        document.body.appendChild(popupEl);
    }

    Schematics: 
    Schematics that are included in the @schematics/angular collection are run by default by the commands ng generate and ng add

    Deployment: https://angular.io/guide/deployment#automatic-deployment-with-the-cli
        eg: ng deploy

    Optimizations:
