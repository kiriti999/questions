    What is polymorphism ?
        The polymorphism is a core concept of an object - oriented paradigm that provides a way to perform a single action in different forms.
 It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects.
class A {
    display() {
        document.writeln("A is invoked<br>");
    }
}
class B extends A {
    display() {
        document.writeln("B is invoked");
    }
}

var a = [new A(), new B()]
a.forEach(function (msg) {
    msg.display();
});
